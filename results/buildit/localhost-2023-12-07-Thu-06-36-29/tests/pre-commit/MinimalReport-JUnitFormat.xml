    This file contains the most essential information from the source Jikes RVM
    XML report for use in systems that support the JUnit XML format. Note that the
    JUnit XML format is actually not defined by JUnit but by the Ant JUnit plugin.

    1. We do not use the errors element because the Jikes RVM XML format does not distinguish between errors and failures.
    we're only using the failures element so the error count is always 0.
    2. We use the error output of testcase elements to save some information from our reports that
    we could not display otherwise.
